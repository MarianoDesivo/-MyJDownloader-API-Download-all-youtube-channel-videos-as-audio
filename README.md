# PyYoutube2JD
Python program that gets all the links in a youtube channel, and downloads them as audio

Currently you have to download the .py file and edit some variables with your data (myjd user, password, downloads directory,etc)
It will download all of the videos (you don't already have in the Downloads tab) in audio format
You can convert them to mp3 (or other formats) with JD build-in scripts (see link: https://board.jdownloader.org/showthread.php?t=70525)
