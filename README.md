# PyYoutube2JD
Python program that gets all the links in a youtube channel, and downloads them as audio. It uses [MyJDownloader API](https://github.com/mmarquezs/My.Jdownloader-API-Python-Library) for python

Currently you have to download the .py file and edit some variables with your data (myjd user, password, downloads directory,etc), see code comments for more details.

It will download all of the videos (you don't already have in the Downloads tab) in audio format. You can convert them to mp3 (or other formats) with JD build-in scripts (see link: https://board.jdownloader.org/showthread.php?t=70525)

Made on windows 10 with Python 3.8.1
